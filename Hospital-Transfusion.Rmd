```{r}
getwd()
Admission_Data = read.csv("C:\\Users\\Mohsen\\Downloads\\Admissions.csv")
Transfusions_Data = read.csv("C:\\Users\\Mohsen\\Downloads\\Transfusions.csv")
Lab_Data = read.csv("C:\\Users\\Mohsen\\Downloads\\Lab.csv")

```

1. Impute the missing charlson_comorbidity_index values in any way you see
fit, with the intention that this variable will be used as a predictor in a
statistical model.
```{r}
## 1. 

# Missing Value imputation
m <- sapply(Admission_Data, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) # 'x' takes all the variables in our dataset
m <- as.data.frame(m)
View(m) # Shows the number of missing values for each variable

#There are 261 missing values in variable. Replacing all missing values with '0' for model fitting purpose
Admission_Data$charlson_comorbidity_index[is.na(Admission_Data$charlson_comorbidity_index)] <- 0
#No missing value found for charlson_comorbidity_index after the imputation
```


2. Determine if there is a significant difference in sex between patients who
had an rbc_transfusion and patients that did not.Fit a linear regression model using the result_value of the “Platelet Count” lab tests
as the dependent variable and age, sex, and hospital as the independent variables.
Briefly interpret the results.
```{r}
##2.

names(Transfusions_Data)
Combined_Data = merge(Admission_Data, Transfusions_Data, by="admission_id")
#The combined data has the records equal to that of the transfusion data

#Loading the required function to get the crosstabs
source("http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~william/R/crosstab.r")
crosstab(Combined_Data, row.vars = "rbc_transfusion", col.vars = "sex", type = "r")
#Interpretation:
#There can be a significant difference in sex between patients who had an 
#RBC Transfusion (with a ratio of ~60:40) as compared fo those who didn't 
#( with a proportion of ~56:44)
```

4. Create one or multiple plots that demonstrate the relationships between
length_of_stay (discharge date and time minus admission date and time),
charlson_comorbidity_index, and age.

```{r}
##3.

#Fitting of the linear regression model:
Lab_Data_subsetted = Lab_Data[Lab_Data$test_code == "PLT",]
Regression_Data = merge(Admission_Data, Lab_Data_subsetted, by="admission_id")
s <- lm(result_value~age+sex+hospital , data = Regression_Data)
summary(s)
#Interpretation:
#From the summary, we can say that the variable sex with male category is the most significant variable with p value = 0.00027( < 0.05) followed by age with p-value = 0.01730( < 0.05)at 5% levle of significance.
#We can also say thaht that variable hospital is insignificant at 5% level of confidence (all p -values are < 0.05)
#There is increase in the result_value of plasma transfusion with an increase in the age of patients, males patients and hospitals like "hospitalSt. Joseph's Health Centre" and "hospitalSunnybrook Health Sciences Centre" and vice versa.
#The overall regression model proves to be significant with a p-value of 0.005084(< 0.05) at 5% level of significance.
```

4. Create one or multiple plots that demonstrate the relationships between
length_of_stay (discharge date and time minus admission date and time),
charlson_comorbidity_index, and age.
```{r}
##4.
#Converting dischage date and admission date to date datatype and discharge time and admission time into timestamp dataatype as they were in string format

#For discharge
Admission_Data$discharge_datetime   <- as.POSIXct(paste(as.Date(Admission_Data$discharge_date, "%d/%m/%Y"), Admission_Data$discharge_time), format="%Y-%m-%d %M:%S")
#For admission
Admission_Data$admission_datetime   <- as.POSIXct(paste(as.Date(Admission_Data$admission_date), Admission_Data$admission_time), format="%Y-%m-%d %M:%S")

#Length of stay computation:
Admission_Data$length_of_stay <- Admission_Data$discharge_datetime-Admission_Data$admission_datetime

#Different plots to analyse the data

#Plot 1: Boxplot of the charlson comorbidity index across length of stay
ggplot(Admission_Data, aes(x=factor(charlson_comorbidity_index),y=length_of_stay,color=age))+
  geom_boxplot(size=1,outlier.shape = 1,outlier.color = "black",outlier.size  = 3) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5,width=.2) + 
  labs(title = "Trend of charlson comorbidity index across different length of stay ", 
       y="Length of stay", x = "Charlson Comorbidity Index") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()
#In this plot, the density of colour represents the age of patient, darker the shade, higher the age.

#Plot 2: 
#Scatter plot to see the clusters of charlson comorbidity index created across differnet age valuea
ggplot(Admission_Data,mapping = aes(x=age,y=length_of_stay,fill=charlson_comorbidity_index))+
  geom_point(color=Admission_Data$charlson_comorbidity_index,alpha = .7, size = 3) +
  #scale_x_continuous(breaks =seq(0,30,5))+
  #scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(2,18,2))+
  labs(title = "Relationship between Age & Charlson Comorbidity Index")
```

5. You are interested in evaluating the effect of platelet transfusions on a
disease. The patients with platelet_transfusion represent the selected treatment
group. Select a control group in any way you see fit.
How could you improve your selection if you had more data and access to any
clinical variable you can think of?
```{r}
##5. 

Max_Platelet_Transfusion <- max(Lab_Data[Lab_Data$test_code =="PLT","result_value"])
Max_Platelet_Transfusion
#As the maximum result value from platelet transfusion is 401 units, the control group will be the one having the result value near 401 units.

Range_Platelet_Transfusion <- range(Lab_Data[Lab_Data$test_code =="PLT","result_value"])
Range_Platelet_Transfusion
#With more data and access to any other clinical variable, the range of the
#result value at a patient level will be higher and that would increase the 
#condidence interval and ensure that the result values of the 
#new patient having the clinical variable transfusion will lie in that particular range 
#just like the range of platelet transfusion is 0 t0 401.

```


6. Fit a first-iteration statistical model of your choosing to predict the
result_value of the “Hemoglobin” lab tests and evaluate its performance.
How could you improve the model if you had more data and access to any
clinical variable you can think of?
```{r}
##6.

library(MASS)
Hemoglobin_Data = Lab_Data[Lab_Data$test_code =="RBC",]

#Merging with the admission data to run a step wise iterative regression model 
#with age, hospital and sex as the predictors

Hemoglobin_Data = merge(Admission_Data, Hemoglobin_Data, by="admission_id")
Hemoglobin_Data_Updated <- Hemoglobin_Data[complete.cases(Hemoglobin_Data),] #removal of all rows having missing values
# Fit the full model 
full.model <- lm(result_value~age+sex+hospital, data = Hemoglobin_Data_Updated)
# Stepwise regression model
step.model <- stepAIC(full.model, direction = "both",trace = FALSE)
summary(step.model)
#With the iterative statistical technique of stepwise regression, we can 
#say that the overall regression model is significant with p-value = 0.0002423 (<0.05) at 5% level of sifnificance.
#Also the variables like max patients and hospotal like hospitalToronto Western Hospital have turned out to 
#be significant (p-value < 0.05) at 5% level of significance.

#How could you improve the model if you had more data and access to any 
#clinical variable you can think of?

#The model can be improvided with more numeric values and an indepth analysis can be gauged.
#Also, with increase in the number of records, more variability in the data can be onserved 
#thereby the results and conclusion obtained with a larger dataset for any 
#clinical variable would increase the reliability of the results obtained through model fitting and 
#thereby increase the accuracy of our conclusions.
